# GameHoard Website Project with Python and Django Framework
This website was created using the django framework. Its theme is that of an online 'game cubbard'. It lets users create and update records of the games they own, add and remove items from a wishlist, read reviews generated by web scraping with beautifulsoup, and search API results based on user input.

## Skills Implemented
- <b>Agile project management:</b> created and submitted sucessive iterations of the app, adding features and functionality with each generation.
- <b>Azure Dev Ops:</b> collaborated with team members to plan and track code assignments via the cloud.
- <b>Git and PyCharm Version Control:</b> coordinated branching and push requests to record changes to the project over time and avoid code conflicts.
- <b>Django Framework:</b> implemented the Model-View-Template architecture. Leveraged dganjo tags to include content throughout multiple templates. Implemented models and forms to both collect and display information. 
- <b>BeautifulSoup:</b> extracted data from HTML and XML documents by parsing with the beautiful soup python library. BeautifulSoup source content credit: [BoardGameQuest](https://www.boardgamequest.com/category/game-reviews/)
- <b>API:</b> submitted application programming interface requests to gather content and to return results based on user input. API source content credit:  [CheapShark](https://apidocs.cheapshark.com/#c33f57dd-3bb3-3b1f-c454-08cab413a115)
- <b>Google:</b> debugged code using multiply online resources.
 
## Sprint Overview
During a two-week sprint, team members were tasked with completing various front and back end features to produce a viable app to be included as part of an online portfolio. 
The sprint was real-world experience as part of a large, multi-person group project. 
Specific tasks were assigned by the sprint leader, to be completed within a certain timeframe and meeting set parameters.
- Sprint duration: 2 weeks
- 10 stories assigned and (all) completed
- Daily standups
- Friday code retrospectives
- Discord for chat and troubleshooting

# Code Summary
![CRUD](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/readme/GameHoardCRUD.gif)

## [Models](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/models.py)
Two databases were created for this project: 
- Game databaste: record user form input of games in their collection.
- WishList database: populate a form for each beautifulsoup and API result, and then create or delete a record by clicking 'like' button.

## Index Page
The index (home) page is where users can create a database record for a game in their collection, access a link to another page to edit it, view records in the WishList DB, view rendered beautifulsoup content, and view rendered API content. It is where a lot of other functions come together. Multiple CRUD fuctions have been abstracted, so the user experiences everything seamlessly on (almost) one page. 
- CREATE function is accessed via an included modal from [GH_create.html](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/templates/GameHoard/GH_create.html) (see modal instructions in [gameHoard.js](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/static/js/gameHoard.js)). The function must be included as part of this view, since here is where the CREATE function is actually performed (by being included, the modal is part of this page)..
- READ function in this view accesses the model manager and returns all records. The html content is included from [GH_read.html](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/templates/GameHoard/GH_read.html), where it is parsed as as_p and as as_table.
- BEAUTIFULSOUP web scraping is rendered by calling the create_soup function
- API info is passed in from the api and apiQuery functions
