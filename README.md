# GameHoard Website Project with Python and the Django Framework
This website was created using the django framework. Its theme is that of an online 'game cubbard'. It lets users create and update records of the games they own, add and remove items from a wishlist, read reviews generated by web scraping with beautifulsoup, and search API results based on user input.

## Skills Implemented
- <b>Agile project management:</b> created and submitted sucessive iterations of the app, adding features and functionality with each generation.
- <b>Azure Dev Ops:</b> collaborated with team members to plan and track code assignments via the cloud.
- <b>Git and PyCharm Version Control:</b> coordinated branching and push requests to record changes to the project over time and avoid code conflicts.
- <b>Django Framework:</b> implemented the Model-View-Template architecture. Leveraged dganjo tags to include content throughout multiple templates. Implemented models and forms to both collect and display information. 
- <b>BeautifulSoup:</b> extracted data from HTML and XML documents by parsing with the beautiful soup python library. BeautifulSoup source content credit: [BoardGameQuest](https://www.boardgamequest.com/category/game-reviews/)
- <b>API:</b> submitted application programming interface requests to gather content and to return results based on user input. API source content credit:  [CheapShark](https://apidocs.cheapshark.com/#c33f57dd-3bb3-3b1f-c454-08cab413a115)
- <b>Google:</b> debugged code using multiply online resources.
