# GameHoard Website Project with Python and Django Framework
This website was created using the django framework. Its theme is that of an online 'game cubbard'. It lets users create and update records of the games they own, add and remove items from a wishlist, read reviews generated by web scraping with beautifulsoup, and search API results based on user input.

## Skills Implemented
- <b>Agile project management:</b> created and submitted sucessive iterations of the app, adding features and functionality with each generation.
- <b>Azure Dev Ops:</b> collaborated with team members to plan and track code assignments via the cloud.
- <b>Git and PyCharm Version Control:</b> coordinated branching and push requests to record changes to the project over time and avoid code conflicts.
- <b>Django Framework:</b> implemented the Model-View-Template architecture. Leveraged dganjo tags to include content throughout multiple templates. Implemented models and forms to both collect and display information. 
- <b>BeautifulSoup:</b> extracted data from HTML and XML documents by parsing with the beautiful soup python library. BeautifulSoup source content credit: [BoardGameQuest](https://www.boardgamequest.com/category/game-reviews/)
- <b>API:</b> submitted application programming interface requests to gather content and to return results based on user input. API source content credit:  [CheapShark](https://apidocs.cheapshark.com/#c33f57dd-3bb3-3b1f-c454-08cab413a115)
- <b>Google:</b> debugged code using multiply online resources.

# Code Summary
![CRUD](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/readme/GameHoardCRUD.gif)

## Index Page
The [index (home) page](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/templates/GameHoard/GH_index.html) is where users can create a database record for a game in their collection, access a link to another page to edit it, view records in the WishList DB, view rendered beautifulsoup content, and view rendered API content. 
It is where several functions come together. These CRUD functions have been abstracted, so the user experiences everything seamlessly on (almost) one page. 
https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/1843001951039e2a3bad32a7aecd14588784f724/templates/GameHoard/GH_index.html#L6-L81
- CREATE function is accessed via an included modal from: [GH_create.html](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/templates/GameHoard/GH_create.html) (see modal instructions in [gameHoard.js](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/static/js/gameHoard.js)). The function must be included as part of this view, since here is where the CREATE function is actually performed (by being included, the modal is part of this page)..
- READ function in this view accesses the model manager and returns all records. The html content is included from [GH_read.html](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/templates/GameHoard/GH_read.html), where it is parsed as as_p and as as_table.
- Beautifulsoup web scraping is rendered by calling the create_soup function and passing its content in via a variable.
- API info is passed in from the api and apiQuery functions.

## Models
Two databases [models](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/models.py) were created for this project: 
- Game databaste: create a record from form inputs of games in the user's collection. 
- WishList database: populate a form for each beautifulsoup and API result, and then create or delete a record by clicking 'favorite' button.

https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/c8685717c233ee5333e5dc06daf7c79c938c2228/models.py#L3-L41

## Create Form ~ Game database
[This modal](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/templates/GameHoard/GH_create.html) is accessed by clicking on an element (button) in GH_index.html.
By using the django include tag, it's like this content is part of the [GH_index document](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/templates/GameHoard/GH_index.html).
Therefore, the form and the function to create a record, is defined as part of the [GH_index function in views.py](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/views.py).
JavaScript is used to show and hide this element as a modal pop up, see  [gameHoard.js](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/static/js/gameHoard.js).
https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/655a0c33e7d9c7c2a48e118493d47370c074dcac/templates/GameHoard/GH_create.html#L12-L23

## Create Form ~ WishList database
[This form](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/templates/GameHoard/GH_create_wishlist.html) is defined by action = a django url tag, which points to a 'shortcut' in urls.py, which points to a function in views.py.
The function to create a WishList record is defined in [views.py](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/views.py).
By using the django include tag, it's like this content is part of the parent document.
And because it's being included INSIDE an iteration loop (in [GH_read_soup](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/templates/GameHoard/GH_read_soup.html) and [GH_read_api](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/templates/GameHoard/GH_read_api.html)) it can access the django tags with each iteration's specific info.
This content is 'triggered' by clicking the submit element.
https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/655a0c33e7d9c7c2a48e118493d47370c074dcac/templates/GameHoard/GH_create_wishlist.html#L9-L15

## Create Function (views.py)
Recall that the function to create a record in the Game database is part of the [GH_index function in views.py](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/views.py), 
discussed above- it takes user input from a form ([GH_create.html](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/templates/GameHoard/GH_create.html)) and saves it to the Game database.  

To create a WishList record, the function gathers dynamic content from each beautifulsoup and API result. As each result is read and rendered as content, a form is generated as well: 
https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/655a0c33e7d9c7c2a48e118493d47370c074dcac/templates/GameHoard/GH_create_wishlist.html#L9-L15

The inputs of each form is then called by the create_wishlist function, and used to create a record when the 'favorite' button is triggered. The input forms are hidden with CSS, so all the user sees is the 'favorite' button. 
https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/c8685717c233ee5333e5dc06daf7c79c938c2228/views.py#L219-L232

## Read
Displaying the Game and WishList databases call all records via each model manager. 
A template is used in each case to add styling to each record. 
In the case of the Game database, records are displayed in paragraph format, but also rendered as a table, 
which is a modal the user can hide or display by the click of a button (toggled with JavaScript), see  [gameHoard.js](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/static/js/gameHoard.js).
https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/1843001951039e2a3bad32a7aecd14588784f724/templates/GameHoard/GH_read.html#L1-L62

## Update and Delete ~ Game database
The [update page](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/templates/GameHoard/GH_update.html) is accessed by clicking on an element (anchor) in another document ([GH_read.html](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/templates/GameHoard/GH_read.html))
The 'UpdateGame' is a 'shortcut' defined in [urls.py](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/urls.py), which points the way to a function in [views.py](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/views.py).
The views.py function (in this case named 'updateGameDB') passes in the primary key from the element that was initially clicked.
https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/1843001951039e2a3bad32a7aecd14588784f724/templates/GameHoard/GH_update.html#L11-L21

The [delete form](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/templates/GameHoard/GH_delete.html) is included in the update page as a modal popup, see  [gameHoard.js](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/static/js/gameHoard.js).
https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/1843001951039e2a3bad32a7aecd14588784f724/templates/GameHoard/GH_delete.html#L9-L20

Confirming 'DELETE' in the modal popup submits the form and deletes the record. 
https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/c8685717c233ee5333e5dc06daf7c79c938c2228/views.py#L76-L97

## Delete ~ WishList database
When each WishList record is read and rendered from the database, a form is created using each record's primary key and it is assigned an action that will call the [delete_wishlist function in views.py](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/main/views.py).
https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/1843001951039e2a3bad32a7aecd14588784f724/templates/GameHoard/GH_read_wishlist.html#L3-L19

https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/c8685717c233ee5333e5dc06daf7c79c938c2228/views.py#L240-L245

## BeautifulSoup Web Scraping
BeautifulSoup source content credit: [BoardGameQuest](https://www.boardgamequest.com/category/game-reviews/)

To provide dynamic content on the page, beautifulsoup was used to scrape a popular board game review page. The results of the list were iterated through and rendered as html objects. 
https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_Django_GameHoardWebsite/blob/c8685717c233ee5333e5dc06daf7c79c938c2228/views.py#L115-L141

## API Requests

Another source for dynamic content is by using an application programming interface to request data from a website. The returned request was parsed into a dictionary, which was then iterated through and rendered as html objects.
